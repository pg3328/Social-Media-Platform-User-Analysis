## Dataset
- The database ig_clone is created using SQL.
- There are 7 tables: Users, Photos, Likes, Comments, Follows, Tags, and Photo Tags.
- Data is collected for two years 2016 & 2017

## Explorations

All explorations are conducted by aggregating data from multiple years. A dynamic dashboard is then generated, allowing users to view the analysis for each individual year or in cumulative form. This choice can be made through a dropdown menu with multiple options. 
 - Number of users on the Platform
 - Number of posts posted on the platform 
 - Avg time spent by a user 
 - popular hashtags
 - The days of the week when accounts are most commonly created
 - Number of Posts of Most Active Users (To understand the skewness in the posts data)
 - Are the most active users same as the ones who have the most likes for their posts?
